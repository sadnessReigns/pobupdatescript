What script does:
0. Removes any currently existing PoB from applications folder
1. Downloads .zip file from the link you copied
2. unzips it
3. moves PoB application into applications folder
4. fixes an issue that doesn't allow you to run the app
   - Script has an option to open PoB right after it finishes all operations, just add "-open" after script call:
